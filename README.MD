This app enables the user to keep track of its to-do items. Upon first launch, three items are shown that describe how to use the app. The user can add more items by filling these in in the inputfield on top, and then clicking the add button. Checking a todo item when it has been done, is done through switching the UIswitch. All of these actions are saved in a database. An item could be completely deleted by swiping left on it, after which the user gets the option to delete it.

In the 'doc' folder, six screenshots can be found that show different states for the app:
- todoFirstLaunch shows the three items that are shown upon first launch.
- todoItemDelete shows the interface of deleting an item.
- todoItemInputfield shows a new item filled in in the inputfield.
- todoItemAdded shows the item added to the tableView, after pressing the add button.
- todoItemChecked shows an item checked by the UISwitch.
- todoLandscape shows the landscape interface of the app.
